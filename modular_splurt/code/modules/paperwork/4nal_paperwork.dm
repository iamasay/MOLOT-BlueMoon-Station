	I finally got all the materials together, had to steal most of them from that witch everyone loves, but I did. Today's the day that I perform my first summoning. I think I will go for a low-class cubus, probably of the suc variety, after all a sexy, busty lady such as I can't be tempted by a lowly whore!
<br><br>
<b>〇〇〇—7th—〇〇〇〇</b>
	I was wrong... It appears using that witch's reagents changed the result, something obvious in hindsight... along with assuming that I could control a cubus... I ended up calling a hellhound cubus, it finally left a few hours ago, but with the swell of my belly and the leak of my breast I fear it left a gift... I dare not leave this room for now, as my reputation would be ruined, I'll just let this pass... at least their type seem to gestate fast.

	He's back, come for his child like any caring father, and seems to be here for me as well, I'm not even sure I want to resist, my knees shake, my heart quickens, and I go slicker than snowmelt in his presence..."
<br>
<br><br>
	Most of the rest of the note is illegible, smeared ink, off-white stains, and worse smudge it.  On the back remains a single note in a different script, seemingly burned in with exactness rather than inked.
<br><br>
	'I will help you, you bratty child, even if I believe you deserve such a fate for stealing from my poor student...
